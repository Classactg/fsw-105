I really think the classes have a big difference in functionallity. One reads the code over and over to aquire certain orders, numbers, reorders, and gives orders. Javascript's a powerful programming language that's gonna change everything. It has a partner in crime called Node. Together these languages are a definate benefit for anyone looking to be precise and reliable in any form of business, career, or just personal pleasure.
    Making my mind work with the instructors and classmates was like being in a job setting and getting to know everyone and how I can learn for myself and learn from them how things work. Most of the time work with instructors but because they know the criteria. It was great working with them as well as the students. Not too challenging at all because I'm easy going. 
The workload has picked up substantially but of course working with the instructor and classmates I've been able to balance out all the obsticles of difficulty. Remember it's not what you know but who you know. Get to know the class and see how their experience can help yours or lack there of. Also have fun and learn to relax.
    It is paramount to understand the languages we are picking up for future positions or similar. It can save you money and also make you money depending on the profession. Cyber Security consist of my favorite function. Programming a search light to look back and forth 24 hours a day 365 days a week. Or a program that checks your bank account as it grows over night everynight in your sleep. Or a wardrob that needs no stylist, or a planner that can set everything for you without you even thinking about it just by where you go and how you conduct business or make purchases.
